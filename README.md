# Frontend Mentor EasyBank landing page practice

## Brief

Build a landing page as similar as possible to the design pictures as possible with only html, css and javascript.

Users should be able to

- View optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.

# Approach

For this website practice, I took on a mobile first design approach working with mobile viewports first and utilising mixin breakpoints to call for media queries. I chose this approach because people are more often visiting websites on mobile devices and tablets than desktops due to the ease of use and convenience. I think people will more often be disappointed with a badly designed website for mobile than on desktop.

I used HTML and SASS for the CSS framework: this was my first time using SASS so I was also looking up a lot of things as I worked through the project, following [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzNf0liwUzMN6_pixbQlMhQ). This was a great introduction into utilising a CSS framework for my first time and I think I gained a lot of knowledge and efficient workflow practices from the tutorials especially.

# Challenges

I am still becoming more comforatble with flexbox and grid, and laying out the mockup pictures to overlap some of the dividers was a struggle. However, I believe I'm a lot more confident with both these methods and the intracacies of them as I tried to use one of each for the features and article sections.

I think for a better experience, the navbar should be a sticky bar so that it follows along a the user scrolls down, however this was really difficult as it upset the overlay toggle menu. I will find a better solution for this in the future as I improve my JavaScript.
